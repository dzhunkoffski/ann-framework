# ann-framework

Artificial Neural Network framework which allows to build MLP. It has almost the same interface as Pytorch, more details on this framework and its demonstration with [MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data) dataset [here](test-and-demonstrate.ipynb). 
* Modules supported by framework: `Linear`, `BatchNormalization`, `Dropout`, `ReLU`, `Sigmoid`, `Softmax`, `LogSoftmax`,
* Loss functions: `MSELoss`, `CrossEntropyLoss` 
* Optimizers `SGD`, `Adam`
* `DataLoader`, `Sequential`
